                            With the data that we have collected from our experiment we have been able to form some conclusions to the effects that different controllers make on movement and coordination in a 3D environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is quite apparent from the results that the different controller types can create a noticeable difference between each other, when trying to perform a task in a 3D environment. This is shown by the consistent differences in time when using specific controllers. The Keyboard and mouse was almost always the best, with the gamepad coming second and the tablet taking the longest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is shown by the differences in the mean and median values of the results, with the tablet taking considerately longer than the other two control schemes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We feel that the method that we employed to help remove bias from the order that the controllers we used worked, as the number of different orders and samples taken seem to have cancelled out any obvious bias that could have occurred. We feel that thanks to this, if others were to follow our method then they would get similar results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The preferences that the subjects had did not really change a great deal. Most of them started preferring the mouse and keyboard, however almost all of the subjects that preferred the gamepad changed their mind to the keyboard and mouse after using it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The big thing that has been shown in this experiment is that the tablet was almost universally disliked. We asked for feedback on the questionnaires about the controller types. The mouse and keyboard got comments like <em>“ease of control”</em> or <em>“mouse too sensitive for precise movements”</em> showing that whilst liked, it could be better. This is the same with the gamepad with comments such as <em>“Controller was more comfortable (ergonomic)”</em> and <em>“easy to use however it was a bit sluggish”</em>. The tablet however was not liked. It received comments such as <em>“awkward to move around”</em> and <em>“hard to navigate”</em>, it even received a comment that included some ‘colourful’ language describing it. It was not just bad comments however such as <em>“able to tap on the whole screen is a plus”</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion however we feel that the different types of controller have a large impact on movement and coordination in a 3D environment and that our hypothesis was correct.
