                            This document is to fully explain the experiment that we are conducting on the effects of different controllers on movement and coordination in a 3D game environment. The reason we are experimenting on this is due to academic interest into how a 3D environment can possibly effect the user, and their ability to carry out a simple task of building a virtual structure, which was built beforehand in the same environment to be used as an example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The hypothesis is that different control types can create a noticeable difference between each other, which led to questions such as: What are their preference before and after testing?, Why did they make those choices?, and why did these choice end up with that performance?. The reason these questions are important since when design new 3D environments there needs to be early consideration into what control scheme methods do they want end users to use. This can affect the overall design of the environment to give access to that control method based on pre-defined conceptions about it. That is why it is important to research the types of control methods that end users may, or may not use to find the best scheme to base early design off ensure better end-delivery to their end user.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The solution to this is to do research with a controlled group of participants to find out what their pre-defined notions of the control schemes are, and which that they are actually performing the best with. This data can then be used to make design choices early on during development of future products that need a defined control method.
