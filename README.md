# Research-Website
  
Launch Page: index.html
This website uses Google fonts, which are some custom fonts that require internet connection
to be fetched from Google servers. The website can still be run locally, the computer just needs
internet access or some less suitable backup fonts will be used.



The website was built on top of the HTML5 Boilerplate. This provides Boilerplate HTML code with some JavaScript plugins 
and css that help with compatibility in older browsers (IÂ£ 6+). We are not using any of their pre-made website 
designs/templates, just the raw framework (i.e All the CSS they provide is used to fix problems on older browsers). 
For more information on this, visit this website:
https://html5boilerplate.com/

As this adds a ton of extra files, below I will list all the files that we made or have heavily modified:
experiment.html
favicon.ico
index.html
results.html
team.html
js/main.js
css/main.css (Scroll down to section labeled "Author's custom styles")
All in img directory
