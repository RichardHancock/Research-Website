# Research-Website
  
Launch Page: index.html

The website was built ontop of the HTML5 Boilerplate. This provides Boilerplate page layouts with some JS plugins 
and css that help with compatibility in older browsers (IÂ£ 6+). We are not using any of their pre-made website 
designs/templates, just the raw framework (i.e All the CSS they provide is used to fix problems on older browsers). 
For more information on this, visit this website:
https://html5boilerplate.com/

As this adds a ton of extra files, below I will list all the files that we made or have heavily modified:
experiment.html
favicon.ico
index.html
results.html
team.html
js/main.js
css/main.css (Scroll down to section labled "Author's custom styles")
All in img directory
